# AnyConnect-Server
Installation Script for Cisco AnyConnect

Deploy a Cisco AnyConnect compactable ocserv server on Linux (Tested on Ubuntu)</br>
This project is heavely inspired from the github user <a href='https://github.com/sfc9982'> sfc9982 </a> project. </br></br>
For this you need two servers, one in Iran and the other outside of Iran.</br>
you can google it or using websites like [Sindad](https://sindad.com/) or [Mihan Webhost](https://mihanwebhost.com/) or any other services you like.</br>
Note: You don't need anything fancy, even the most basic and simple plans of the VPS's will do the magic.</br>
For the foreign server I'd recommend [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) or something that will give you VP's hourly.
<hr>
Your server inside Iran will act as a router. It's only job is to route traffic from within the country to the main server (non-IR) which hosts the actual ocserv. </br>
All commands are base on debian-based linux distros. e.g. Ubuntu.</br></br>
